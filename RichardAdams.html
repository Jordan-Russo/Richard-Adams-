<p class="bio-text">Richard Adams was a highly influential English author who wrote the best-selling hit novel <q>Watership Down</q> along with other tales such as <q>Plague Dogs</q> and <q>Shardik</q>. Adams is infamously known as a pioneer into the dark fiction genre for children and doesn't shy away from the harsh truths of life which is heavily reflected in his novels as adversities that his characters need to overcome. Despite using only animals to tell his stories, Adams manages to capture the soul-gasping spirit that encapsulates the essence of the hero's journey to his readers.<p>
